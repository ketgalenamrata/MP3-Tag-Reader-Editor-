🎵 MP3 Tag Reader and Editor
Project Overview
This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application developed in C to interact with MP3 audio files. Its primary function is to read, display, and edit the metadata, or ID3 tags, embedded within an MP3 file.

This project was developed as a hands-on assignment for the Embedded Systems Course at Emertxe Information Technologies, focusing on low-level file manipulation and data parsing techniques.

🚀 Key Features
ID3v2 Support: Specifically designed to parse and handle the complex structure of the ID3v2.3 tag format, ensuring correct frame identification and data extraction.
View Mode (-v): Reads and displays key ID3v2 tags such as Title, Artist, Album, Year, Genre, and Comment.
Edit Mode (-e): Allows the user to modify the values of existing supported ID3v2 tags by calculating and adjusting frame sizes.
Robust Error Handling: Includes checks for file existence, validity of the MP3 signature, and the presence of ID3 tags.
🛠️ Technology Stack & Concepts
Component	Description
Language	C
Platform	Linux (Terminal Environment)
Core Concepts	File Handling (fopen, fseek, fread, fwrite), Bitwise Operations (for syncsafe integers and flag parsing), Structs, Pointers, and Command Line Argument Parsing.
⚙️ Usage
The application supports two primary modes: View (-v) and Edit (-e).

1. View Mode: Displaying Tags
To view the tags of an MP3 file, use the -v option:

./mp3tag -v <mp3_filename>

Example:

./mp3tag -v MyFavoriteSong.mp3

2. Edit Mode: Modifying Tags
To edit a specific tag, use the -e option along with the appropriate modifier and the new value:

./mp3tag -e <mp3_filename> <tag_modifier> <new_tag_value>

Modifier	Tag to Edit (ID3 Frame)
-t	Title (TIT2 frame)
-a	Artist (TPE1 frame)
-A	Album (TALB frame)
-y	Year (TYER frame)
Example: To change the Album of the song:

./mp3tag -e MyFavoriteSong.mp3 -A "Greatest Hits Collection"
